# The ARITH language:

For the input AST of an arithmetic expression, implement an interpreter in the form of a function called "eval" which takes in the AST  and returns the evaluated result for that expression

## New feature: 

We have added the Modulo operator in addition to the required Sum and Mul operators

## Running the file

$javac Arith.java <br />
$java Arith

## Test cases

expr = (5+3) * 2 == 16 <br />
expr = ((3+5) * (2+8)) % (2*5) == 0
