# Arith-While-Interpreter
An implementation of interpreters for a) arithmetic expressions and b) expression in the WHILE language

## Arithmetic expressions
For the input AST of an arithmetic expression, implement an interpreter in the form of a function called "eval" which takes in the AST and returns the evaluated result for that expression

### Running the file

$javac Arith.java <br />
$java Arith

### Test cases

expr = (5+3) * 2 == 16 <br />
expr = ((3+5) * (2+8)) % (2*5) == 0

b) For the input AST of an expression in the WHILE language, implement an interpreter in the form of a function called "eval" which takes in the AST and returns the evaluated result for that expression
